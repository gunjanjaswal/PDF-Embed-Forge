Embed a PDF right inside a post or page with a clean, responsive, full-width viewer. Add it with a block or a shortcode. No third-party services.

== Description ==

PDF Embed Forge drops a PDF straight into your content so readers can scroll through it without leaving the page. Pick a file from your Media Library (or paste a URL), choose a height, and you are done.

It uses the browser's own PDF viewer, so there is no heavy library to load and nothing is sent to an outside service. Your files stay on your own site.

**What you get**

* A "PDF Embed Forge" block for the editor, with a live preview while you set it up.
* A `[pdf-embed-forge]` shortcode for the classic editor, widgets, or anywhere shortcodes run.
* Control over the viewer height and the built-in toolbar.
* Fits the page to the viewer width and hides the thumbnail sidebar for a clean, full-width read.
* Responsive by default, so it fits phones as well as wide desktop layouts.
* Translation ready, properly escaped output, and no settings page to wade through.

== Installation ==

**From your dashboard**

1. Go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
2. Choose `pdf-embed-forge.zip` and click **Install Now**.
3. Click **Activate**.

**Manually over FTP/SFTP**

1. Unzip the download and upload the `pdf-embed-forge` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Go to **Plugins** in WordPress and activate **PDF Embed Forge**.

There is no settings page. Once it is active you can add PDFs straight away.

== How to use ==

**Embed a PDF with the block**

1. Edit a post or page.
2. Click the **+** (block inserter) and search for **PDF Embed Forge**.
3. Add the block, then click **Upload** or **Media Library** and pick your PDF.
4. In the block sidebar, set the **viewer height**, show or hide the **toolbar**, and type an **accessible title** if you like.
5. Use the toolbar's **Replace PDF** button any time you want to swap the file.
6. Publish. The PDF shows up inline, fitted to the width of your content.

Tip: to run the viewer edge to edge, select the block and choose **Wide width** or **Full width** from the block toolbar.

**Embed a PDF with the shortcode**

Use the shortcode when you are in the classic editor, a widget, or a template file.

Embed a file from your Media Library by its attachment ID:

`[pdf-embed-forge id="123"]`

Embed any PDF by its URL, taller and with the toolbar hidden:

`[pdf-embed-forge url="https://example.com/files/report.pdf" height="800" toolbar="0"]`

Call it from a template with `do_shortcode()`:

`<?php echo do_shortcode( '[pdf-embed-forge id="123"]' ); ?>`

**Finding a PDF's attachment ID**

Open **Media → Library**, click the PDF, and read the `item=` number in the URL, or copy the file URL and use it with the `url` attribute instead.

**Shortcode attributes**

* `id` — Media Library attachment ID of the PDF.
* `url` — Direct URL to a PDF (used if no `id` is given).
* `height` — Viewer height in pixels. Default `600`.
* `toolbar` — `1` to show the viewer toolbar, `0` to hide it. Default `1`.
* `title` — Accessible title for the viewer (read by screen readers).

The older `[pdf-forge]` shortcode still works as an alias, so anything you built before the rename keeps running.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work on mobile? =

Yes. On phones, where inline PDF frames are cramped (and unreliable in iOS Safari), the embed shows the PDF's first page with a "View in Full Screen" button that opens it in the device's full-screen viewer. The first-page image is the one WordPress generates on upload; if your host can't make it, a document icon is shown instead. The inline viewer is used on larger screens.

= Can I hide the toolbar or the pages sidebar? =

The thumbnail sidebar is hidden automatically for a clean read. To hide the toolbar as well, set `toolbar="0"` on the shortcode or flip the toggle in the block sidebar. These are honoured by Chromium-based browsers; others simply show their own controls.

= Can I embed a PDF hosted on another site? =

Yes, pass its full URL to the `url` attribute. Note that some hosts block being shown inside a frame, which is their setting rather than something the plugin controls.

= Does it send my PDFs anywhere? =

No. The browser loads the file straight from your site. Nothing is uploaded to or proxied through any external service.

= Is there a settings page? =

No. Everything is configured per embed, on the block or the shortcode.
