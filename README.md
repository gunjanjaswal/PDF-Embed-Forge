# 📄 PDF Embed Forge

### Embed PDFs directly inside your WordPress posts and pages

A lightweight PDF embed plugin with a Gutenberg block **and** a shortcode. It uses the browser's own PDF viewer, so there's no bulky library to load and nothing ever leaves your server.

## ✨ What it does

Most PDF embeds either drop a plain download link, or pull in a megabyte of JavaScript to render something the browser already renders perfectly well. PDF Embed Forge takes the lighter road: it points the browser at your file and lets its built-in viewer do the work. You pick a PDF, set a height, and your readers scroll through it without ever leaving the page.

No account, no API key, no external request. The file stays on your own site.

## 📦 Installation

**From your dashboard**

1. Go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
2. Choose `pdf-embed-forge.zip` and click **Install Now**.
3. Click **Activate**.

**From this repository**

1. Download the latest release, or clone the repo.
2. Put the folder in `wp-content/plugins/` as `pdf-embed-forge`.
3. Activate **PDF Embed Forge** on the Plugins screen.

There is no settings page, so you can start embedding right away.

## 🚀 How to use

### Embed a PDF with the block

1. Edit a post or page.
2. Click the **+** block inserter and search for **PDF Embed Forge**.
3. Add the block, then click **Upload** or **Media Library** and pick your PDF.
4. In the block sidebar, set the **viewer height**, show or hide the **toolbar**, and add an **accessible title** if you want one.
5. Use **Replace PDF** in the block toolbar any time you need to swap the file.
6. Publish. The PDF appears inline, fitted to your content width.

> **Tip:** To run the viewer edge to edge, select the block and choose **Wide width** or **Full width** from the block toolbar.

### Embed a PDF with the shortcode

Reach for the shortcode in the classic editor, a widget, or a template file.

Embed a file from the Media Library by its attachment ID:

```text
[pdf-embed-forge id="123"]
```

Embed any PDF by URL, taller and with the toolbar hidden:

```text
[pdf-embed-forge url="https://example.com/files/report.pdf" height="800" toolbar="0"]
```

Call it from a template:

```php
<?php echo do_shortcode( '[pdf-embed-forge id="123"]' ); ?>
```

> The older `[pdf-forge]` shortcode still works as an alias, so anything built before the rename keeps running.

### Shortcode attributes

| Attribute  | Description                                                   | Default |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `id`       | Media Library attachment ID of the PDF.                       | —       |
| `url`      | Direct URL to a PDF (used when no `id` is given).             | —       |
| `height`   | Viewer height in pixels.                                      | `600`   |
| `toolbar`  | `1` shows the viewer toolbar, `0` hides it.                   | `1`     |
| `title`    | Accessible title for the viewer, read out by screen readers. | —       |

### Finding a PDF's attachment ID

Open **Media → Library**, click the PDF, and read the `item=` number in the address bar. Or copy the file URL and use the `url` attribute instead.

## ❓ FAQ

**Does it work on mobile?**
Yes. On phones, where inline PDF frames are cramped (and unreliable in iOS Safari), the embed shows the PDF's first page with a "View in Full Screen" button that opens it in the device's native viewer. The preview image is the one WordPress generates on upload; where the host can't make one, a document icon is shown instead. Larger screens get the inline viewer.

**Can I hide the toolbar or the pages sidebar?**
The thumbnail sidebar is hidden automatically. To hide the toolbar too, set `toolbar="0"` or flip the toggle in the block sidebar. Chromium-based browsers honour it; others show their own controls.

**Can I embed a PDF hosted somewhere else?**
Yes, pass its full URL to the `url` attribute. Bear in mind some hosts block being embedded in a frame, which is their setting, not the plugin's.

**Where do my PDFs go?**
Nowhere new. The browser loads the file straight from your site. Nothing is uploaded to or routed through any outside service.

## 🧩 WordPress.org ready

Built to the [WordPress.org plugin guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/): a proper `readme.txt`, a unique prefix, escaped output, sanitised input, a bundled translation template, and GPL-2.0-or-later licensing, with no external calls. It passes the official [Plugin Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/) plugin.

## 🛠️ Development

The block is written in plain `wp.element` calls with no build step, so the source in `assets/js/block.js` is exactly what runs. Clone the repo into `wp-content/plugins/pdf-embed-forge` and start editing.
